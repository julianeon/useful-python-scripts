# Useful Python Scripts

![example gif](output.gif)

Example gif created by make_gif.py.

## make_gif_images.py

This script generates the images for a gif using imagemagick (must be installed).

The text to be used, and the filenames used for output, are coded into the script.

It doesn't create a gif in case you want to add a custom image or change the ordering before gif creation.

Run it like this:

python make_gif_images.py

## make_gif.py

This script generates a complete gif using imagemagick (must be installed). 

It is very similar to make_gif_images.py, with an extra line at the end to create a gif from those images.

The text to be used, and the filenames used for output, are coded into the script.

Run it like this:

python make_gif.py
